 * **9/1/2021** - started working on v1.2 - adding a dialog gui. ~~check out [the branch](https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/Pi-Assistant/tree/dialog-gui-testing) if you want to test it.~~ edit: the branch is nonexistent, I merged it.
 * **10/1/2021** - GIANT UPDATE: finished rewriting everything for the 2nd time (:tired_face:) then figured out how to merge a conflicting branch (gave up so I downloaded the test branch and deleted it along with everything in the main branch, then I uploaded all the scripts again). at least now everything should work!<br>
added flags to piassist (and main.sh), run `piassist --help` to see all of them.
* **19/1/2021** - UPDATE: v1.2 final, added system info script, fixed a few bugs, fixed updater at last!
* **23/1/2021** - UPDATE: v1.2.1 - fixed `--no-internet` and `--no-update` flags don't work when launching using `piassist`, made startup time after option completes way shorter using the `--no-internet flag` (that make Pi-Assistant not check for internet and updates, so makes startup time way faster).
* **5/2/2021** - found out why the updater refreshed the menu and desktop shortcuts even when no updates are available, pushed the fix to the beta branch.<br>Updated etcher install script to always download and install latest release and made it use a better system architecture detection. fixed a few typos in different files.<br>getting ready to merge the beta branch and release v1.3.0!
* **8/2/2021** - tons of improvements over the last few days, running flags from `piassist` redirect the flags to `main.sh`, added shorter versions of some flags (`-v` = `--version`).
