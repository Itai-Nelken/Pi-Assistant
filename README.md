### Fixed temporarily
- zoom installer is broken because it can't download zoom for some reason

 
## To do:

- [x] return to main menu instead of exiting when executed command finishes
- [x] add uninstall script
- [x] add updater script 
- [ ] make updater script to run on startup
- [x] add zoom & box86
- [x] add box86 as standalone app 
- [x] add etcher (newest version, the one with 'Flash from URL' and 'clone drive'). (added as of v1.1.3, installs 32 or 64 bit             version depending on your system architecture)
- [ ] add USBImager
- [ ] add speedtest-cli
- [ ] add browsh
- [ ] add box86 install script for 64bit OS's


## FAQ

### why is the main script called system-tools-v.1.1.1.sh?
* because before I split the script, I changed the name every release. but now changing the name would mean finding all the places where the name appears and changing it, I might do it in the future.
