## Some scripts
### do something if command succeeds/fails
**Usage:** `./script.sh command` but change `script.sh` with the scripts name and `command` with a command.<br>
EXAMPLE: `./script.sh "echo test"
```bash
#!/bin/bash

$1 2> /dev/null
RESULT=$?
if [ $RESULT == 0 ]; then
  echo "command '$1' is a ran successfuly"
else
  echo "command '$1' failed"
fi

```
